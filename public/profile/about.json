    "about": " Hi there, Hello! \n\n\n  Welcome to my portfolio, where I focus on developing practical, safe, and reliable AI solutions. My research spans active and incremental learning, anomaly and out-of-distribution detection, and the optimization of AI models for real-world deployment. \n Outside of AI, I enjoy DIY embedded systems, home automation, and photography. When Iâ€™m not immersed in the tech world, you'll find me volunteering to make the world a better place, one step at a time.",
